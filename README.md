# AoETaunts
Age of Empires 2 was and still is an amazing game. The taunts you could send to you friends through the chat made it even better.</br>
Now with Aoe2 Taunts you can use the taunts anytime you have your smartphone with you! Just use the .apk-file in the git repository and you'll have the prettiest and easiest to use AoE2 taunt app available!</br>
</br>
If you dont want to install a "unknown" .apk file you can clone the repo and check the source code yourself.</br>
</br>
The app is written in Java and is quite flexible, you could replace the button icons and sound files in the drawable and raw folder and it will run.</br>
</br>
The layout file is simply a TableLayout that gets populated with as many icons as you want.</br>
Icons and sound files are matched together using a simple naming system, name+number.ending, for example "its_good17.png" and its_good17.ogg. When loaded the icons will be ordered by the number.</br>

#### This is what the app looks like: </br>
